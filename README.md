The results and code of ***Probabilistic Maps of White Matter Hyperintensity based on a Large-scale Chinese Aging Cohort and their Application for Clinical Diagnosis***

# White Matter Probability Maps
The constructed white matter probability maps are based on the Chinese Brain Molecular and Functional Mapping (CBMFM) data. The subjects' demographics are as follows:

# Segmentation model
The original code comes from [nnU-Net](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet). The pre-trained model uses the CBMFM data, in /WMH_segModel.
